# Car Assistant

### Overview

This is a camera app that continuously detects the objects (bounding boxes and
classes) in the frames seen by your device's back camera, using a quantized
[MobileNet SSD](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection)
model trained on the [COCO dataset](http://cocodataset.org/). These instructions
walk you through building and running the demo on an Android device.

This project is just lite version of Self Driving Cars ML project(https://github.com/dylan-007/Self-driving-cars). This application Detects objects like car, bus, truck and gives warning alert if object is very closed wich is approximately 5 meteres from camera.
